# Continuation of lambda functions in Docker image

## Cloud Research

- I managed to get the credentials set up with Docker, tag the image after building it and pushing it to a new repo on ECR.
- My lambda function does not work however and I have to find out why. There seems to be a configuration error, which I will check out tomorrow since I didn't have time to correct it today. I think we're almost there.
