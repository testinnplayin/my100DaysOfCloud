# IAM User Management

## Introduction

Considering that I had to make an IAM user for day 2, I already basically started the project over [here](https://github.com/100DaysOfCloud/100DaysOfCloudIdeas/blob/master/Projects/SEC/SEC04/SEC04-AWS100.md) so I decided to work on this some more.

User management is super important. Previous work experience in DevOps, even though not directly on the cloud, I had to do a lot of user management. Whenever someone joined or left the company, often times I had to play around with credentials and roles/permissions. It is good to know how to do this on the cloud as well.

## Use Case

- Add a new IAM user so that they can use my aws account.
- Create or modify IAM user policies.
- Add a new IAM user group.

## Cloud Research

- There are a lot of potential actions and policies! I think that this is a very deep subject and thus a very deep rabbit hole to fall down. I am just scratching the surface.
- At least I know how to enforce a somewhat okay password policy. I also know how to set up MFA with an IAM user.
